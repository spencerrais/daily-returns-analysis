The first thing to be done is to import the data and ensure it comes in currectly.

```{r}
returns = read.table("Returns250d.txt",header = TRUE)
returns$blank <- NULL #erase the first column, which is unnecessary
```

The time series is plotted to give a general feeling of the data. When looking at the data there are a lot of N/A which seems to mean that the company was not being traded at that moment yet.

```{r}


```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
